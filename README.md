# XML to SFM

Convert FLEx XML files (`.flextext`) into Paratext USFM files. Given that the
semantics for the source files are built on interlinear rather than a structure
of Biblical text that is conducive to publishing, there is some waving of hands
involved in this process.

Usage:

    xml2sfm /path/to/input/file.xml [/path/to/output/file.sfm]
